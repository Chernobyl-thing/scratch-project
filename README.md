# About this project
It's a simple scratch slideshow for the CS50 course that I'm following along to. Haven't actually signed up, so this is just for fun.
## INSTALL
It's pretty easy, just download SP.sb3, and import it to scratch by clicking "file", then "Import from your Computer". Navigate to the download directory, select the file, run, and enjoy. It kind of sucks right now, I don't exactly have plans to upgrade it.
